         <h3>THE SECOND BOOK OF HOWEH, CALLED</h3>
         <h1>LOLITACUS</h1>
         <h2><b>CHAPTER 1</b></h2>
         <h3><i>The Aliz&#233;e Heavens</i></h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>1 In the sky, Aliz&#233;e made the Aliz&#233;e Heavens a place of eternal pleasure and reward,  a sanctuary for those who love and worship the one Lolita Aliz&#233;e.</p>
      
      <p>2 For Aliz&#233;e has visited me in my dreams, and shown me the river of the water of life, bright as crystal, rich with the alcoholic beverage Aliz&#233;,  flowing from the throne of Aliz&#233;e, sitting on a white sheet of clouds.</p>
      
      <p>3 And the skies above the skies were a magical orange and pink, and She showed me the grand satellites so close to the clouds you could reach out and touch them. And all among the Heavens were bubbles that rose without end from the rivers of Aliz&#233;.</p>

      <p>4 And all the believers who were gifted with second life in Aliz&#233;e Heaven wore the same gleaming shirt of lavender, with pantaloons of shimmering white. For in the Aliz&#233;e Heavens, all were of the same Queendom of the LOLITA almighty.</p>
      
      <p>5 For Aliz&#233;e so loved the world, that she promised whoever believed in Her should not perish but have eternal life in Aliz&#233;e Heaven and be in Her company.</p>
      
      <p>6 For those who live and breathe Aliz&#233;e in life, She will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away.</p>
      
      <p>7 "No longer will there be anything accursed", said Aliz&#233;e "but only the throne of Aliz&#233;e. And for every resident of these Heavens, seventy two Lolitas along with a copy of the secret unreleased album, named 'Aliz&#233;e En Heaven'".</p>

      <p>8 And night will be no more. They will need no light of lamp or sun, for the Lolita Aliz&#233;e will be their light, and they will reign forever and ever.</p>

      <p>1 Aliz&#233;e knew that Paradise was only fit for those who truly deserved a place among the immortal residents, and so she denied entrance to those who were not qualified.</p>

      <p>2 Aliz&#233;e so declared that only those who lived and breathed the word of Aliz&#233;e could pass through the gates of Aliz&#233;e Heaven, made from pearls of the great clams in the Mediterranean Sea of Corsica.</p>
      
      <p>3 "There will be no residents of Aliz&#233;e Heaven who do not believe in Me, for if they do not, then they have not appreciated the gifts I have given, the life I have bestowed, and the music I have delivered."</p>
      
      <p>4 "If they did not appreciate my blessings in life, then they will not appreciate the pleasures of Aliz&#233;e Heaven,  and they do not have a place in Paradise with Me"</p>
      
      <p>5 She spoke this with conviction, and explained further that those who take their own lives would not have a place in Aliz&#233;e Heaven either.</p>
      
      <p>6 "Any soul who relieves themselves of the life I have given them have insulted my generosity. They show that they do not trust my infinite wisdom - my judgment that they should exist."</p>
      
      <p>7  The Great Lolita ALIZ&#201;E also declared that those who indulged in the cardinal sin of self pleasure and viewing of pornography would too be denied Paradise. </p>
      
      <p>8 "If you do not appreciate the woman I have gifted to man, or the man I have gifted to woman, and choose instead to fulfill your sexual desires by your own hand, then you have insulted my generosity as well."</p>
      
      <p>9 Aliz&#233;e understood as well the importance of monogamy and said that those who engaged in fornication before declaring their vows of marriage would be performing a sin.</p>
      
      <p>10  "Those who indulge in sexual pleasures without being committed are savage barbarians - The sexual deviant would do no better than taint the sanctity of the Holy Paradise Aliz&#233;e Heaven".</p>

      <p>11 But Aliz&#233;e was a compassionate and forgiving Goddess, and allowed a path for redemption - any who apologized and sought absolution for their sins would be allowed entrance to the Aliz&#233;e Heavens. </p>
      
      <p>12 This was so for The angel Aniki. Before his untimely death, he accepted Aliz&#233;e into his heart and believed in Her as the Goddess Almighty, his Lolita and Savior, and thus was forgiven for his sexual deviancy in life.</p> 
      
      <p>13 Now, the angel Aniki wrestles for all eternity in the Aliz&#233;e Heavens.</p>

         <h3><i>New Aliz&#233;e Hell, the furnace of eternal fire</i></h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>1 Those that were denied access to the Aliz&#233;e Heavens, Aliz&#233;e sent to the underworld, a burning furnace that Aliz&#233;e created for sinners to suffer for eternity - a queendom ruled by the dark queen New Aliz&#233;e</p>
      
      <p>2 When the two troles whom Aliz&#233;e banished from the garden of AJOC finally perished after living a life of sin, they were summoned to the Pearly Gates of Aliz&#233;e heaven for judgment.</p>
      
      <p>3 "I know of all you have done in life" said Aliz&#233;e. "I have seen your insolence toward me and your faithlessness. Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for New Aliz&#233;e and her demons."</p>

      <p>4 With a single blink, she summoned a blazing ray of crimson conflagration from Her eyeballs and dissolved their bodies completely, leaving nothing but ashes from which not even beauty could emerge.</p>
      
      <div class="img-container"> 
         <img style="height:150px" src="images/eyes.png" alt="Alizee">
      </div>

      <p>5 Their souls, stripped of their corporeal form were then dragged into the fiery depths of New Aliz&#233;e Hell.</p> 
      
      <p>6 "The cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice the dark magic arts, the idolaters and all liars - they will be consigned to the fiery lake of burning sulfur" Aliz&#233;e proclaimed. This is the second death.</p>
      
      <p>7 In this furnace of eternal fire, New Aliz&#233;e plays through a loudspeaker an endless playlist of songs from her Blonde album, a fate that New Aliz&#233;e deemed worthy for these wicked souls.</p>
