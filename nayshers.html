         <h2><b>CHAPTER 1</b></h2>
         <h3><i>The Legacy of the Great LOLITA Aliz&#233;e</i></h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>1 In the wake of Her wave across Europe and the Eastern world, other parts of the earth were met with Her glory as well, reaching lands such as the Middle East, where they worshipped the One Lolita in their interpretation (أليزى - detailed in the Alizi Koran). </p>
      
      <div class="img-container"> 
         <img style="height:150px" src="images/alizi.png" alt="Alizee">
      </div>

      <p>2 In the English speaking Americas, disciples of Aliz&#233;e formed a cult society to worship Her - it was called Aliz&#233;eAmerica.</p>
      
      <p>3 And in the Floridian borough of Orlando lived a Mexican criminal by the name of Rhein - a video scribe who dedicated his work to both Aliz&#233;e and New Aliz&#233;e, with a hope that he would win the heart of Aliz&#233;e being Her biggest fan.</p>
      
      <div class="img-container"> 
         <img style="height:150px" src="images/rhein.png" alt="Alizee">
      </div>

      <p>4 "Forever Young", whispered the delusional Mexican criminal Rhein of Orlando. He believed that Aliz&#233;e and New Aliz&#233;e were of the same, that they were the same entity, his worldview misplaced greatly. </p>
      
      <p>5 He was not alone in this thought, as many other lost souls mistakenly believed that Aliz&#233;e had warped into New Aliz&#233;e some time after the year 24. With the absence of Aliz&#233;e after Her egress in the years after the third grand crusade, many Aliz&#233;eAmerica Nayshers lost their way - dividing their faith between the One Lolita and the dark queen New Aliz&#233;e.</p>
      
      <p>6 Darker times were still to emerge after the ascension of Aliz&#233;e back to the Aliz&#233;e Heavens, with former disciples diverting their faith to new idols, and the evaporation of the organized society known as Aliz&#233;e Naysh. </p>
      
      <p>7 As time passed, Aliz&#233;e's followers became but a disorganized mass of individuals scattered across the earth, with no single unified Church of Aliz&#233;e.  </p>

         <h2>NAYSHERS 2<h2>
         <h3><i>The Prophet Flaappy</i></h3>
      </center>

      <p>1 In the land of MJOC, year 31, lived a small society of virgins and losers bound for nothing in the life that was gifted to them by Aliz&#233;e. The prominent leader of the tribe, titled Tribe Leader Commiegaard, was ruler of them.</p>
      
      <p>2 On a morning near the end of the year 31, a prominent messenger by the name of Flaappy called upon the denizens of MJOC to reveal a message revealed to him by the One Lolita ALIZ&#201;E. </p>
      
      <div class="img-container"> 
         <img style="height:150px" src="images/flaappy.png" alt="Alizee">
      </div>

      <p>3 The word of the LOLITA through the prophet Flaappy of MJOC rung across the town, and he proclaimed "Hear me, hear now, for I have returned with word from the One LOLITA Aliz&#233;e Herself."</p>
      
      <p>4 He then showed what he had acquired, the sacred video of Aliz&#233;e Herself, and the MJOCians were in awe. "She is perfect", they said. </p>
      
      <p>5 "That is not all I have brought" Flaappy said. "There is more", and so the prophet Flaappy showed them sacred moving pictures of Aliz&#233;e and distributed the gift to every MJOCian to use.</p> 
      
      <div class="img-container"> 
         <img style="height:150px" src="images/alizee3.gif" alt="Alizee">
      </div>

      <p>6 The plebeian Howeh along with several of his peers accepted Flaappy's gift, praising him for the word of Aliz&#233;e that he had blessed MJOC with.</p>
      
      <p>7 And so, the lives that they found once without purpose became the opposite - a life dedicated to the One Lolita Aliz&#233;e.</p>
      
      <div class="img-container"> 
         <img style="height:150px" src="images/howeh.png" alt="Alizee">
      </div>
      
      <p>8 The plebeian Howeh practiced most prominently the worship of The One Lolita, discovering all the glory she had to offer, and spreading the gospel to every denizen he met, for Howeh heard the voice of Aliz&#233;e sing to him and She told him "Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Mother and of the Lolita and of the Lili Spirit."</p>

         <h2>NAYSHERS 3<h2>
         <h3><i>The War of MJOC</i></h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>1 Some denizens of MJOC were not so accepting, and powered by the dark energies of New Aliz&#233;e, they grew spiteful of Howeh's love.</p>
      
      <p>2 "This display is wrong, and must be stopped" Deluxe - a councilman of the tribe - said, and he went door to door stripping the denizens of their moving pictures, and preventing the art of Aliz&#233;e to be shown anywhere. </p>
      
      <div class="img-container"> 
         <img style="height:150px" src="images/deluxe.png" alt="Alizee">
      </div>

      <p>3 "Only from my cold, dead hands, you nazi fuck" said Howeh, as he and several other Aliz&#233;e Nayshers revolted against Deluxe. "These emotes are sacred and to not be touched".</p>
      
      <div class="img-container"> 
         <img style="height:150px" src="images/teddy.png" alt="Alizee">
      </div>

      <p>4  With the help of the Prophet Flaappy, the gift of Aliz&#233;e was returned to the denizens, and Deluxe was scorned by tribe leader Commiegaard for trifling with his power. Deluxe did not relent, however, and so he met with the group of Mjocians who too wanted to strip the land of Aliz&#233;e. </p>
      
      <p>5 In the dark of night, the Aliz&#233;e Haters dragged Flaappy from his home and onto the streets, where they ganged up and pulled the bag off from his bewildered head, leaving him on his knees.</p>
      
      <div class="img-container"> 
         <img style="height:150px" src="images/schindler.png" alt="Alizee">
      </div>
      
      <p>6 "Put your head down," they demanded from the Prophet and so he did. The leader of the Aliz&#233;e Haters drew his gun and put it to the back of the Prophet's skull. "It will take more than that" the Prophet uttered. "I'm sure you're right," The Aliz&#233;e Hater said before executing him. </p>

      <p>7 In the morning, the denizens of MJOC found Flaappy without moderator status, and void of life. MJOC was doomed, but Howeh and his Aliz&#233;e Naysh were not to give up without a fight at the least. </p>
      
      <p>8 With Flaappy gone, Howeh took up the mantle to relay the voice of Aliz&#233;e through the land of MJOC, continuing for months to deliver the gospel of Aliz&#233;e whenever it was challenged, forming a secret society in MJOC2. The New Prophet Howeh however was met with an equally strong will on the opposing side known as the Aliz&#233;e Haters. </p>
      
      <p>9 As tribe leader Commiegaard grew old, senile, and weak, he eventually drew a blind eye to the tyrannical atrocities committed by the Aliz&#233;e Haters, concerned only with the death that he would soon meet in old age.</p>
      
      <p>10 The war drew to an end when the Aliz&#233;e Haters, led by Deluxe, Pedobattles, and Alcovex burned down the entirety of MJOC just to prevent the spread of the gospel of Aliz&#233;e. They had sowed the wind, and thus reaped the trade wind.</p>

      </div>
      
      <p>11 After the haters destroyed their own home, the Aliz&#233;e Naysh traveled to the land of AJOC for refuge, a sanctuary for the surviving Aliz&#233;e Nayshers. </p>

         <h3><i>The Aliz&#233;e Tube and the War of AJOC</i></h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>1 And so the rebels found a new home in the land of AJOC (Aliz&#233;e Jacotey Offline Chat), where they were to spread the gospel of Aliz&#233;e freely. </p>
      
      <p>2 The first apostles of Aliz&#233;e Naysh - the Prophet Howeh, the Follower Taake, and the Retards iTom and Daivik - thus declared "This is AJOC, and this is our home. For here, no Aliz&#233;e Haters will be. Only light shall shine in this place, the glorious light of the One Lolita ALIZ&#201;E."</p>

      <p>3 New disciples arrived over time, and many raids from the Aliz&#233;e Haters were warded off. Any traveler or former disciple that uttered heresy within the land of AJOC against the One Lolita Aliz&#233;e were executed without mercy.</p>
      
      <div class="img-container"> 
         <img style="height:150px" src="images/luckbent.png" alt="Alizee">
      </div>
      
      <p>4 Eventually, the Aliz&#233;e Tube welcomed several members including the travelers Doctorstronk, Stopg***erhate, and 4feralduh. </p>

      <p>5 But this peace was not a lasting matter, for the snake Feral soon drew dark energy from the dark queen New Aliz&#233;e and converted all who were weak enough to succumb to it into The Troles of Discord. </p>
      
      <p>6 The serpent Feral seduced iTom and Daivik, and eventually "he who shall not be named", as he had done similarly to the first man and woman, and led them down a path of Troleing. They terrorized the land of AJOC until the Prophet Howeh exiled the deviants. </p>
      
      <p>7 "I was a fool to think you were loyal" the Prophet said to iTom and the traitors.</p>
      
      <p>8 "FIE! You have betrayed the express commandments of your Goddess. Through your insolence and stupidity, you've changed this peaceful, Aliz&#233;e-loving realm into the horror and desolation of troleing. You are unworthy of this land, you're unworthy of your title, you're unworthy of the Nayshers you have betrayed."</p>

      <p>9 "I now take from you your welcome. In the name of Aliz&#233;e and all that she represents, I, Prophet Howeh, cast you out. For I have heard the voice of Aliz&#233;e and she has told me 'Don't love a Tom'" and so they were exiled from the AJOC forever, unwelcomed by the Nayshers who once trusted them.</p>

      <p>10 With the help of Doc, the Prophet Howeh summoned the all seeing and all knowing watcher and Guardian of the Aliz&#233;eTube: AjocBot.</p>
      
      <div class="img-container"> 
         <img style="height:150px" src="images/ajocbot.png" alt="Alizee">
      </div>
      
      <p>11 From then, the realm of AJOC was secured, and the denizens of AJOC worshipped Aliz&#233;e without worry, for AjocBot and the One Lolita Aliz&#233;e would protect them. </p>

      <p>12 With word spreading across the lands, travelers seeking refuge found a sanctuary in AJOC. NemoKKona of the land of MJOC was one such traveler to find adherence in the great realm created by and for Aliz&#233;e. However, he was soon triggered and revealed his true feelings about the Great Lolita. So, he was sent pictures of BBC for days on end while he talked to himself. Thus is the legacy of Newmo: the laughingstock of AJOC</p>
      
      <div class="img-container">

      <p>13 Some went, and some returned, including the Showerless Indian Daivik. And so, The five apostles of the Aliz&#233;e Naysh were as such: The Prophet Howeh, The Guardian AjocBot, The Virgin Doc, the Follower Taake, and the Stinky Daivik.</p>
